# vue_training

My first touch to Vue. The idea of this project was to learn basics of Vue and not to make an amazing-looking web app.

What did I learn:

- How to setup a Vue project
- How to build a simple single page web app
- Template conditionals, loops and events
- Forms and handling user input
- Dynamic styling, SCSS and global styles
- Routing with Vue router

Things I did include in my project but got familiar with:

- Vue 3 composition API
- Global state management with Vuex 4
